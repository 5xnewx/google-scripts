# Scripts for Google Apps

I recently learned that you can quickly and easily run scripts against your Google Apps. This repo is where I'll keep some scripts that are useful to me, and hopefully others can benefit from them too.

### How to Use Google Scripts

Visit the [Google Scripts](http://script.google.com) site and create your first script. Scripts are stored in Google Drive, so you can edit them there later on.
